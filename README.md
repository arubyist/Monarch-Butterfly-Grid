# Monarch Butterfly Grid

Learning to create a custom CSS grid via this personal project. A work in progress! 

This is a very simple grid with several width choices from: 100%, 50%, 33%, 66%, 25%, and 75%. 

You can use them in any combination that works for you.  


As mentioned, a simple grid, it relies on floats to make this work. There are other choices, such as [Flexbox](https://www.google.com/search?q=css+flexbox+for+css+grids&oq=css+flexbox+for+css+grids&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1629.3564.0.3701.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0.VxPS8i3cQog), or [CSS Layout Grid](https://www.google.com/search?q=CSS+Grid+Layout&oq=CSS+Grid+Layout&gs_l=psy-ab.3...4531.7544.0.7672.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0.LlGbRJKVjTE) ... I will make a version of the CSS grid that uses those as well ... as it is, I'm having fun in bits and pieces in making this grid! =) 

This is a personal project, one that is very much work-in-progress! I'm open to any and all feedback! =) Please do drop a note if you accidentially stumble across this project if you find errors in my work, or things that could be optimized on a different level. Thank you!
