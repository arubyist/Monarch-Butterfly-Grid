# Monarch Butterfly Grid

Learning to create a custom CSS grid via this personal project. A work in progress! 

This is a very simple grid with several width choices from: 100%, 50%, 33%, 66%, 25%, and 75%. 

You can use them in any combination that works for you. 

If you want the width to be constrained instead of stretching to 100% of viewport, use the class container which will constrain it to 90% width.
